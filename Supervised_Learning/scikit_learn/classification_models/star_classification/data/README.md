# README for the Star Classification Dataset

## Overview
The `star_classification.csv` file contains a dataset used for a multi-class classification model aimed at classifying different types of stars based on their physical characteristics. This dataset includes various features that describe the properties of stars, which are essential for training machine learning models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following columns:

- **Temperature (K)**: The temperature of the star in Kelvin.
- **Luminosity (L/Lo)**: The luminosity of the star relative to the Sun.
- **Radius (R/Ro)**: The radius of the star relative to the Sun.
- **Absolute Magnitude (Mv)**: The absolute magnitude of the star.
- **Star Type**: The target variable representing the type of star (e.g., Brown Dwarf, Red Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence, Supergiant, Hypergiant).
- **Star Category**: A broader classification of the star type (e.g., Red, Blue, White).
- **Star Color**: The color of the star, which can provide additional insight into its characteristics.
- **Spectral Class**: The spectral classification of the star, indicating its temperature and color.

## Data Source
This dataset is derived from astronomical observations and is commonly used in studies related to stellar classification and astrophysics.

## Usage
This dataset is intended for use in supervised learning projects, particularly for classification tasks using machine learning algorithms. It can be utilized to train models that predict the type of star based on its physical attributes.

## Additional Information
For further exploration and analysis of this dataset, refer to the accompanying Jupyter notebook located in the `notebooks` directory, which provides visualizations and descriptive analyses to better understand the relationships between the variables.
